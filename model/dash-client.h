   * used for transmitting and receiving http DASH
   * messages with a DASH server.
   *
   * The client requests one segment at a time. When it
   * receives each tcp segment, it uses a HttpParser object
   * to decode the HTTP messages into MPEG frames.
   *
   * These MPEG frames are then passed on to the MpegPlayer object
   * that buffers and reproduces the frames.
   *
   * When an entire segment has been received, then the next segment's
   * bitrate (resolution) and request time are calculated my the MpegPlayer
   * depending on the buffer level, and the current measured throughput.
