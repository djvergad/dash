   * \breif This application was written to complement DashClient. It received
   * requests for MPEG Segments from clients, and responds by transmitting back
   * the MPEG frames that are contained in the frame
   *
   * The constructor specifies the Address (IP address and port) and the
   * transport protocol to use.   A virtual Receive () method is installed
   * as a callback on the receiving socket.  By default, when logging is
   * enabled, it prints out the size of packets and their address, but
   * we intend to also add a tracing source to Receive() at a later date.
